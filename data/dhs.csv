BYU WILL BE DEVELOPING A LOW-HEAD DAM SCREENING TOOL FOR OCCURRENCE OF THE SUBMERGED HYDRAULIC JUMP
OR HYDRAULIC ROLLER AS THIS FLOW BEHAVIOR CAN ENTRAP DRIFTWOOD, DEBRIS, AND PERSONS LEAVING LITTLE POSSIBILITY
FOR ESCAPE. AS NOTED IN THE ABOVE REFERENCE PROPOSAL, MANY FATALITIES DUE TO DROWNING HAVE OCCURRED AT LOW
HEAD DAMS.
INITIAL EFFORTS WITH THE SCREENING TOOL DEMONSTRATE THAT A FIELD CAMPAIGN IS NECESSARY TO MORE ACCURATELY
CHARACTERIZE LOW HEAD DAM SITES FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT AND ASSESSMENT OF THE SCREENING TOOL PERFORMANCE.
THUS, KEY LOW-HEAD DAMS, IDENTIFIED FROM TASK 1, WILL BE VISITED IN THE FIELD BY THE BYU-USU FIELD TEAM
TO COLLECT DETAILED INFORMATION TO EXAMINE HYDRAULIC CONDITIONS USING A COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS MODEL
(CFD) IN TASK 3.
TRAVEL FOR THE FIELD TEAM MAY INCLUDE VEHICULAR TRAVEL WITHIN THE STATE OF UTAH OR NEARBY STATES. OTHER DAM
LOCATIONS OUT OF STATE MAY BE OF A DISTANCE WHERE THE TEAM WILL TRAVEL BY PLANE AND THEN USE A RENTAL VEHICLE
TO PERFORM THE NECESSARY FIELD INVESTIGATIONS.
USU WILL ASSIST WITH THE SELECTION OF LOW HEAD DAM LOCATIONS FOR THE FIELD CAMPAIGN, COLLABORATE IN
ORGANIZING AND SCHEDULING THE FIELD EXCURSIONS AND COLLECTING THE REQUISITE DATA, AND COMPILING THE FIELD
CAMPAIGN DATA INVENTORY OR DATABASE.
TYPICAL DATA TO BE COLLECTED AT LOW HEAD DAM LOCATIONS INCLUDE STRUCTURE GEOMETRY (HEIGHT, WIDTH, AND
SHAPE), DETAILED BATHYMETRIC DATA DOWNSTREAM (STREAMBED AND BANKS), AND MULTIDIMENSIONAL VELOCITY
MEASUREMENTS AND ANY OTHER SITE CHARACTERISTICS AND NOTICEABLE ISSUES THAT MAY IMPACT FLOW COMPUTATION OR
PRESENT HAZARDS.
TASK 3 Ã¢Â‚¬Â€Œ DEVELOP A COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS (CFD) TOOLBOX FOR SIMULATING LOW-HEAD DAM
HYDRAULICS
A THREE-DIMENSIONAL AND ROBUST COMMERCIAL CFD CODE, FLOW-3D, WILL BE APPLIED TO THE LOW-HEAD DAMS
SELECTED FOR DATA COLLECTION IN TASK 2. A CFD MODEL OF ALL FEASIBLE FIELD LOCATIONS WILL BE DEVELOPED TO
SIMULATE DETAILED HYDRAULIC CONDITIONS TO IDENTIFY THE POTENTIAL OCCURRENCE OF THE SUBMERGED HYDRAULIC JUMP.
TWO MAIN OUTCOMES WILL COME FROM THIS EFFORT: 1) THE CFD TOOLBOX IN PDF FORMAT WITH SUPPORTING DATA,
MODEL, AND TRAINING VIDEO WILL ENABLE A NOVICE OR EXPERIENCED ENGINEER TO DEVELOP THEIR OWN CFD MODEL IN
ANY SOFTWARE OF A LOW-HEAD DAM OF INTEREST AND 2) THE RESULTS WILL ASSIST IN IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTORS
FOR IDENTIFICATION ERRORS USING THE SCREENING TOOL. THE DETAILED DATA WILL BE CATALOGUED FOR USE IN SUBSEQUENT
TASKS.
THIS EFFORT WILL BE LED BY DR. CROOKSTON IN CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH A GRADUATE STUDENT. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT
THESE EFFORTS WILL ALSO BE COMPILED AND PUBLISHED IN A USU MASTERÃ¢Â‚¬Â„¢S THESIS AND ANY DERIVED CONFERENCE OR
ACADEMIC JOURNAL PUBLICATIONS, IN AGREEMENT WITH THE SPECIFICATIONS OF THIS PROJECT BY FEMA IF AWARDED.",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_70RSAT24CB0000011_7001_-NONE-_-NONE-/,2025-01-28 00:00:00+00

GENERAL
A.	BACKGROUND

(1)	ACCORDING TO PRESIDENTIAL POLICY DIRECTIVE 8: NATIONAL PREPAREDNESS (PPD-8), THE NATION MUST MAINTAIN A LEVEL OF PREPAREDNESS FOR THE FULL SPECTRUM OF HAZARDS AND THREATS WHICH FACE THE COUNTRY. NATIONAL PREPAREDNESS REQUIRES EFFORTS TO BE MADE ACROSS FIVE MISSION AREAS: PREVENTION, PROTECTION, RESPONSE, RECOVERY, AND MITIGATION. THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCYÃ¢Â‚¬Â„¢S (FEMA) MANDATE IS TO BUILD AND MAINTAIN A CAPABILITY TO PREPARE FOR, PROTECT AGAINST, RESPOND TO, RECOVER FROM, AND MITIGATE ALL HAZARDS. MOST OF THE PREPAREDNESS EFFORTS FEMA CONDUCTS ARE FOCUSED ON ALL-HAZARDS PREPAREDNESS. REGARDLESS OF THE CAUSE, FEMA MAINTAINS THE PERSONNEL, SUPPLIES, AUTHORITIES, TOOLS, AND CAPABILITIES TO RESPOND TO ANY HAZARD.

(2)	ON FEBRUARY 3, 2022, THE FEMA ADMINISTRATOR ISSUED A MEMO TITLED Ã¢Â‚¬Å“PREPAREDNESS STRATEGY FOR THE EMERGING THREAT OF CYBER INCIDENTS WITH PHYSICAL CONSEQUENCES.Ã¢Â‚¬Ï¿½ ALTHOUGH CYBER-ATTACKS WITH DISRUPTIVE AND DESTRUCTIVE CONSEQUENCES WERE DESCRIBED, THE MEMO DIRECTED THE AGENCY Ã¢Â‚¬Å“TO ADOPT A MORE CONCERTED APPROACH TO STRENGTHENING OUR OWN READINESS AND HELPING OUR FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, TRIBAL, AND TERRITORIAL PARTNERS TO STRENGTHEN THEIRS.Ã¢Â‚¬Ï¿½ THE FEMA CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL AND NUCLEAR (CBRN) OFFICE WITHIN ORR IS DIRECTED TO FOCUS BEYOND THE CBRN ENTERPRISE (WHILE STILL SUSTAINING AND ENHANCING CBRN ENTERPRISE) TO EMERGING THREATS NOT INVOLVING CBRN. THE NEW OET WILL ADDRESS UNIQUE CHALLENGES POSED BY THESE THREATS AND ASSOCIATED HAZARDS WITH AN IMMEDIATE EMPHASIS ON CYBER INCIDENTS WITH PHYSICAL CONSEQUENCES.

(3)	AN Ã¢Â‚¬Å“EMERGING THREATÃ¢Â‚¬Ï¿½ IS DEFINED AS ONE THAT MAY BE NEWLY RECOGNIZED; MAY HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED BEFORE, BUT WITH NEW OR DIFFERENT IMPACTS; OR MAY BE AN EXISTING THREAT THAT HAS DEVELOPED NEW ATTRIBUTES THAT POSE A CHALLENGE TO EXISTING FEMA AND MISSION PARTNER CORE CAPABILITIES TO RESPOND AND TO RECOVER FROM SUCH THREATS AND HAZARDS. EXAMPLES INCLUDE CYBER-ATTACKS, RESURGENT NATION-STATE THREATS, AND CLIMATE CHANGE, AMONG OTHERS. ADDRESSING SUCH THREATS REQUIRES CLOSE LINKAGES BETWEEN INTELLIGENCE, DATA ANALYTICS, AND ASSESSED RISK TO DRIVE FEMA AND MISSION PARTNER RESPONSE AND RECOVERY CAPABILITY DEVELOPMENT, PLANNING, AND OPERATIONS.

(4)	THE VISION OF OET IS TO HELP FEMA AND ITS MISSION PARTNERS UNDERSTAND AND ADDRESS A WIDE ARRAY OF NOVEL EMERGING THREATS. OET REPRESENTS THE Ã¢Â‚¬Å“BRIDGEÃ¢Â‚¬Ï¿½ NEEDED TO FILL THE GAP BETWEEN EMERGING THREATS IDENTIFIED BY THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY (IC) OR OTHER INFORMATION SOURCES, AND THE RISK-INFORMED DEVELOPMENT, MANAGEMENT, AND DELIVERY OF FEMA AND MISSION PARTNER OPERATIONAL CAPABILITIES.

(5)	MISSION: THE MISSION OF OET IS TO IDENTIFY, ASSESS, AND INFORM FEMA AND ITS MISSION PARTNERS OF EMERGING THREATS THAT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY CHALLENGE THE NATIONÃ¢Â‚¬Â„¢S CORE CAPABILITIES FOR INCIDENT RESPONSE AND RECOVERY. THIS MISSION IS CONSISTENT WITH THE ADMINISTRATORÃ¢Â‚¬Â„¢S 2022 ANNUAL PLANNING GUIDANCE AND OBJECTIVE 3.2 (Ã¢Â‚¬Å“POSTURE FEMA TO MEET CURRENT AND EMERGING THREATSÃ¢Â‚¬Ï¿½) OF THE 2022-2026 FEMA STRATEGIC PLAN. IT IS ALSO ALIGNED WITH FEMA THREAT AND HAZARD IDENTIFICATION AND RISK ASSESSMENT (THIRA) DOCTRINE.

(A)	GOAL 1: DEVELOP A COLLABORATIVE FOCAL POINT WITHIN FEMA TO WORK WITH MULTIPLE ENTITIES INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL TO THE AGENCY TO IDENTIFY AND ASSESS EMERGING THREATS AND CORRESPONDING RISKS TO INFORM AND ENABLE FEMA AND ITS MISSION PARTNERS TO RESPOND AND RECOVER FROM SUCH THREATS.

(B)	GOAL 2: USING A COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIP APPROACH, TRANSLATE ANALYSIS OF THREATS AND RELATED RISKS INTO ACTIONABLE GUIDANCE AND INFORM THE DEVELOPMENT OF SPECIALIZED PLANS, RESOURCES, AND CAPABILITIES TO ADDRESS GAPS RELATED TO SPECIFIC EMERGING THREATS IN COORDINATION WITH RELEVANT INTRA AND INTERAGENCY AND MISSION PARTNERS.
 


(C)	GOAL 3: ENHANCE FEMAÃ¢Â‚¬Â„¢S CAPABILITIES TO RESPOND TO AND RECOVER FROM EMERGING THREATS ONCE SUCH THREATS ARE ACTUALIZED EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY.

(D)	GOAL 4: STRENGTHEN PARTNERSHIPS AND INFORMATION SHARING BETWEEN FEMA",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_70FA5024F00000127_7022_70FA5024A00000004_7022/,2025-03-05 00:00:00+00
