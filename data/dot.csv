AS PART OF THIS MODERNIZATION, API ENDPOINTS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FOR ACCESSING THE DATA. THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THE NEW CRASH TEST DATABASE SIGNAL ANALYSIS TOOLS (RFP: 693JJ923R000183) PROGRAM IS TO DEVELOP A WEB APPLICATION VERSION OF THE NHTSA VEHICLE SAFETY RESEARCH SIGNAL ANALYSIS TOOL TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE EXISTING WINDOWS-BASED PROGRAM AND TOWARDS A TOOLSET ACCESSIBLE THROUGH A WEB BROWSER. ELEMANCE WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES (WFUHS) TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEW SIGNAL ANALYSIS TOOL WEB APPLICATION. THE ALLOCATION OF EFFORT FOR EACH TASK IN THE RFP HAS BEEN OUTLINED IN THE FULL PROPOSAL PREPARED BY WFUHS AND ELEMANCE. INITIALLY, ELEMANCE WILL ASSIST WFUHS IN DEVELOPING A TASK IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (C.5.2). THE GOAL OF THE TASK IMPLEMENTATION PLAN IS TO DETAIL THE SCHEDULE, TECHNICAL APPROACH, CODE REVIEW, AND DOCUMENTATION STRATEGY FOR THE SIGNAL ANALYSIS TOOL. ONCE THE DRAFT PLAN HAS BEEN APPROVED BY NHTSA, THE PROJECT TEAM WILL PROCEED WITH TOOL DEVELOPMENT (C.5.3). THE TEAM OF ENGINEERS AT ELEMANCE DEDICATED TO SUPPORTING THIS PROGRAM HAVE EXPERIENCE IN EACH COMPONENT OF THE DESIGN PROCESS REQUIRED TO MAKE THE SIGNAL ANALYSIS WEB APPLICATION A SUCCESS, INCLUDING FRONT END USER INTERFACE DEVELOPMENT, DATABASE AND API ABSTRACTION, FUNCTIONAL AND OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING FOR SIGNAL ANALYSIS, AND EXPERIENCE IN CALCULATING AND VISUALIZING THE METRICS REQUIRED BY THE DELIVERED TOOL. ELEMANCE WILL ASSIST WFUHS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF FRONT-END INTERFACES FOR INTERACTING WITH AND VISUALIZING SIGNAL DATA, BACK-END INFRASTRUCTURE FOR INTERACTING WITH THE DATABASE APIS, AND FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING FOR CALCULATIONS PERFORMED ON SIGNAL DATA OBTAINED FROM THE DATABASE. IN THE EVENT THAT OPTIONAL TASK C.5.4 IS EXECUTED, ELEMANCE WILL ALSO SUPPORT WFUHS ENGINEERS IN THE EXPANSION OF THE SIGNAL ANALYSIS TOOLS TO INCLUDE THE FEATURES OUTLINED IN THE RFP. ELEMANCE WILL SUPPORT THIS EFFORT BY PROVIDING OBJECTORIENTED PROGRAMMING AND CONTRIBUTING TO THE FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING REQUIRED TO INTEGRATE THE ADDITIONAL FEATURES REQUESTED BY NHTSA. ELEMANCE HAS ALSO PUT TOGETHER A TEAM OF ENGINEERS CAPABLE OF SUPPORTING AN ADDITIONAL OPTIONAL TASK (C.5.5) THAT, IF EXECUTED, WILL FOCUS ON DEVELOPING ADDITIONAL FEATURES DESIRED OR REQUESTED BY NHTSA. WHILE NO DELIVERABLES FOR THIS OPTIONAL TASK ARE OUTLINED IN THE RFP, THE ALLOCATION OF EFFORT FOR THE ELEMANCE PROJECT TEAM HAS BEEN COMMITTED WITH PERCENTAGES COMMENSURATE WITH THE OTHER TASKS WITHIN THE RFP",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_693JJ923F000258_6940_693JJ921D000024_6940/,2025-03-31 00:00:00+00
