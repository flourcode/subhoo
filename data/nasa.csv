INSTRUMENT PRELIMINARY DESIGN, WITHIN REQUIREMENTS WITH APPROPRIATE MARGINS, ACCEPTABLE RISKS, AND
WITHIN COST AND SCHEDULE CONSTRAINTS. TO THIS END, THE UMN LUSEE-NIGHT TEAM HAVE IDENTIFIED THE
WORK REQUIRED DURING THIS TIME PERIOD FOR THE INSTRUMENT BASED ON THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN
COMPONENT DESIGN ENVIRONMENTS AND THE EXPECTED OPERATING ENVIRONMENT. THIS WORK FOCUSES ON
COLLECTING ALL RELEVANT DESIGN DOCUMENTS AND REVIEWING THE INTERFACES BETWEEN THE LUSEE-NIGHT
COMPONENTS AND PREPARING THE INSTRUMENT FOR A PRELIMINARY DESIGN, DOCUMENTING THE BLOCK DIAGRAMS
OF MAJOR COMPONENTS, DETERMINING DETAIL DESIGN CIRCUITRY AND DEVELOPING A FLIGHT-GRADE COMPONENT
LIST. THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC WORK ELEMENTS ARE PROPOSED TO FURTHER DEVELOP THE LUSEE-NIGHT ELECTRONICS
AND DIPOLE ANTENNA:

1. UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA (UMN) SYSTEMS ENGINEERING (SE)
OVERALL SYSTEMS ENGINEERING SUPPORT OF THE WORK PERFORMED AT UMN AND COORDINATION OF
DESIGN WORK AND INTERFACES AT PARTNER INSTITUTIONS. THE SYSTEMS ENGINEER WILL PARTICIPATE IN
COMMUNICATIONS, MEETINGS, PROJECT REVIEWS, AND PROVIDE INPUTS TO TECHNICAL AND FINANCIAL
REPORTING AS NEEDED.
DELIVERABLES INCLUDE:
Ã¢Â‚¬Â¢ COMPONENT- AND SUBSYSTEM-LEVEL REQUIREMENTS;
Ã¢Â‚¬Â¢ INTERFACE CONTROL DOCUMENT INPUTS;
Ã¢Â‚¬Â¢ RISK REGISTER AND ASSOCIATED MITIGATION PLANS;
Ã¢Â‚¬Â¢ SMA PARTS LISTS REVIEW AND FLIGHT PARTS RECOMMENDATIONS.

2. UMN SUPPORT FOR LUSEE IMPLEMENTATION AT DOE
UMN WILL COORDINATE WITH DOE SCIENCE LABS AT BROOKHAVEN AND LAWRENCE-BERKELEY IN
TERMS OF THE DESIGNS FOR THEIR PARTS OF LUSEE-NIGHT. UMN WILL ASSESS THE DESIGNS, INTERFACES
AND SUITABLE FLIGHT PARTS WHICH WILL SURVIVE SPACE ENVIRONMENTS.
SPECIFIC TASKS INCLUDED IN THIS WORK ELEMENT ARE AS FOLLOWS:
A. IT WILL BE IMPORTANT IN THE DOE DELIVERY TO INCLUDE DESIRED PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS OF
THE PARTS. OVERALL PROJECT EFFORT WILL BE REDUCED IF DOE PROVIDES THE PRODUCE SPECIFICATIONS
(PDF) SO SUITABLE FLIGHT-GRADE PARTS CAN BE FOUND.
B. IF THERE ARE PROBLEMS FINDING EQUIVALENT FLIGHT PARTS, COMMERCIAL PARTS CAN SOMETIMES BE
UPGRADED TO FLIGHT BY ENVIRONMENTAL TESTING AT THE PART LEVEL. IF THIS PATH IS USED, TESTING
COULD BE SUBCONTRACTED BY DOE. THERE IS NO BUDGET INCLUDED AT UCB FOR THIS.

3. UMN SUPPORT OF PFPS DEVELOPMENT
UMN WILL BEGIN TO CONSIDER THE DESIGN OF THE PICKET FENCE POWER SUPPLY (PFPS) TO BE USED
WITH THE LUSEE-NIGHT INSTRUMENT.

4. UMN SUPPORT OF C&DH DEVELOPMENT
UMN WILL BEGIN TO CONSIDER THE DESIGN OF THE COMMAND AND DATA HANDLING (C&DH) TO BE
USED WITH THE LUSEE-NIGHT INSTRUMENT.
SPECIFIC TASKS INCLUDED IN THIS WORK ELEMENT ARE AS FOLLOWS:

THE SCIENCE TEAM, WILL CONTINUE TO COORDINATE THESE ACTIVITIES TO ENSURE COHESION BETWEEN THE
TEAMS AND SYNERGY WITH THE LARGER CYGNSS MISSION. IN THE TASK PROPOSED HERE, SHE WILL CONTINUE
TO WORK WITH THE CYGNSS PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR (PI), PROF. CHRIS RUF, LEADS OF OTHER CYGNSS
WORKING GROUPS, AND THE OTHER PIS OF THE LAND APPLICATIONS PROJECTS TO FINE-TUNE AND KEEP TRACK
OF THE PRIORITY AREAS, ACTIVITIES, AND TIMELINES TO MAXIMIZE THE SCIENCE VALUE AND QUALITY OF LANDBASED
PRODUCTS FROM CYGNSS OBSERVATIONS. SHE WILL ALSO WORK WITH THESE TEAMS FOR PROPER
DOCUMENTATION OF ALGORITHMS AND PRODUCTS, FOLLOWED BY DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS TO THE PROJECT. THE
TEAM WILL CONDUCT THE MAJORITY OF ITS BUSINESS VIA EMAIL AND WEBEX CONFERENCE CALLS, WHILE ALSO
ALLOCATING SUBSTANTIVE TIME FOR DISCUSSIONS AND PLANNING AT THE SEMI-ANNUAL ST MEETINGS.
THE PROPOSED UNDERGUIDE SET OF ACTIVITIES IS FOCUSED ON COORDINATION OF THE LAND APPLICATIONS
WORKING GROUP (LAWG). IT MAY ALSO INCLUDE SOME NOMINAL EFFORT TO MAINTAIN THE EXISTING SOIL
MOISTURE CAL/VAL SITES FOR THE MISSION.
THE USC PI, MOGHADDAM, WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE CYGNSS MISSION PI IN ALL ASPECTS
RELATED TO THE ACTIVITIES OF THE LAWG. TOGETHER WITH THE LAND APPLICATIONS SCIENCE TEAM
MEMBERS, SHE WILL LEAD THE FOLLOWING ACTIVITIES:
1. ASSEMBLE AN INVENTORY OF ALL OF THE L2 PRODUCTS OVER LAND BEING GENERATED BY THE
CYGNSS LAND APPLICATIONS TEAMS
2. ASSESS PROVENANCE AND STATUS OF ALGORITHM MATURITY FOR ALL OF THE L2 PRODUCTS BEING
GENERATED BY THE ST LAND APPLICATIONS TEAMS
3. DEVELOP FORWARD MODEL BENCHMARKING EXERCISES TO ALLOW INTER-COMPARISON OF DIFFERENT
SCATTERING MODELS BEING DEVELOPED, ESPECIALLY FOR SOIL MOISTURE PRODUCTS
4. FINE-TUNE AND MATURE THE VALIDATION PLAN FOR L2 LAND-BASED PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SURFACE
AND ROOT-ZONE SOIL MOISTURE AND WETLANDS MAPS); NOTE THAT A DRAFT PLAN HAS BEEN PRODUCED IN THE
CURRENT PHASE OF THE PIÃ¢Â‚¬Â„¢S ACTIVITIES, WHICH IS A LIVING DOCUMENT AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE UPDATED
5. CONTINUE TO PROVIDE REQUESTS FOR LAND SCENES FOR RAW IF MODE DATA REQUESTS
6. ENSURE TIMELY REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION OF ALGORITHMS AND LATEST SCIENTIFIC PRODUCTS
(BOTH PROJECT INTERNAL DOCUMENTS AND PEER-REVIEWED PUBLICATIONS)
7. WORK WITH THE MISSION PROCESSING TEAM TO SELECT A GEOGRAPHIC PROJECTION GRID FOR LAND L2
PRODUCTS
8. SELECT A DAAC FOR THE LAND L2 PRODUCTS (IF PO-DAAC IS NOT SUITABLE)
9. DEVELOP TUTORIAL PRESENTATIONS AND ONLINE MODULES TO ENABLE WIDESPREAD UNDERSTANDING
AND USE OF CYGNSS DATA AND LAND-BASED PRODUCTS
10. WORK WITH LAND APPLICATIONS ST MEMBERS TO ARRIVE AT A UNIFORM STRATEGY FOR OPEN
DISSEMINATION OF ALGORITHMS VIA INDUSTRY-STANDARD TOOLS AND REPOSITORIES

THIS NEXTSTEP CONTRACT BUILDS UPON THE SUCCESS OF COMMERCIAL ORBITAL TRANSPORTATION SERVICES SPACE ACT AGREEMENT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AND AN EXISTING INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISS) COMMERCIAL RESUPPLY SERVICES (CRS) CONTRACT. ORBITAL HAS SUCCESSFULLY TRANSITIONED FROM COTS TO THE CRS PROGRAM, FLYING THREE VERY SUCCESSFUL PRESSURIZED CARGO RESUPPLY MISSIONS TO THE ISS, USING THE CYGNUS SPACECRAFT. ORBITAL ALSO SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOPED SPACECRAFT FOR SOLAR SYSTEM EXPLORATION TO INCLUDE THE CURRENTLY OPERATIONAL DAWN MISSION. THIS MISSION WAS LAUNCHED IN SEPTEMBER 2007, COMPLETED ITS RENDEZVOUS MISSION AT VESTA IN JULY 2012 AND IS EN ROUTE TO CERES IN EARLY 2015.  WITH SPACE AGENCY BUDGETS CONTINUING TO BE TIGHT, EXPLORATION PLANS NEED TO EMPHASIZE EVOLUTION OF EXISTING SYSTEMS, WHERE COST AND SCHEDULE IS BETTER CONTROLLED, AND DEVELOPMENT RISK REDUCED. SPECIFICALLY, ELEMENTS OF THE CURRENT ISS, INCLUDING CYGNUS, CAN BE EVOLVED TO SUPPORT MORE DISTANT SPACE DESTINATIONS. TO SUPPORT THESE ENDEAVORS, ORBITAL CONTRIBUTES TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCT IMPROVEMENT OF CYGNUS AND TO NEXTSTEP ACTIVITIES AND HAVE INVESTED IN THE COTS CRS PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP ENDEAVOR.  ORBITAL'S EXPLORATION AUGMENTATION MODULE (BAM) ARCHITECTURE USES A MODULAR, BUILDING BLOCK APPROACH THAT LEVERAGES THE CYGNUS SPACECRAFT TO EXPAND CISLUNAR AND LONG DURATION DEEP SPACE TRANSIT HABITATION CAPABILITIES AND TECHNOLOGIES CRITICAL TO NASAS LONG-TERM EXPLORATION GOALS.  ORBITALS ARCHITECTURE CONCEPT BLENDS IN-PRODUCTION HARDWARE WITH ADAPTATION, EVOLUTION, PLANNING, AND FORWARD THINKING. CYGNUS WILL SERVE AS A MODULAR HABITAT AND TEST PLATFORM FOR QUALIFYING TECHNOLOGIES IN A DISTANT RETROGRADE ORBIT (DRO) OR IN A LOW EARTH ORBIT (LEO), EITHER WHILE ATTACHED TO THE ISS OR AS A FREE-FLYER. USING THE EXISTING, OPERATIONAL CYGNUS TO PERFORM THESE MISSIONS HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF DECREASING OVERALL DEVELOPMENT TIME AND COSTS, AND FREEING UP RESOURCES THAT WOULD BE SPENT ON DEVELOPING A SPACECRAFT TO FOCUS ON CULTIVATING MISSION ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES.  THE GOAL IS TO HAVE A CYGNUS DERIVED EAM DEPLOYED IN CISLUNAR SPACE BEFORE 2020. THIS SPACECRAFT WILL BE THE FIRST BUILDING BLOCK IN SUPPORTING BOTH COMMERCIAL MARKETS AND GOVERNMENT OBJECTIVES. THE PROPOSED EFFORT FOR THIS NEXTSTEP BAA PHASE I, INVOLVES DEFINING AN EAM ARCHITECTURE AND CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS (CONOPS) THAT ADDRESSES COMMERCIAL MARKETS AND NASA EXPLORATION OBJECTIVES, TECHNOLOGY MATURATION PLANNING AND INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT, AND TO IDENTIFY TECHNOLOGIES THAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED AND DEMONSTRATED IN THE ISSILEO ENVIRONMENT WITHIN THE NEXT THREE YEARS.

THE SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES TO BE CONDUCTED ARE AS FOLLOW:
1. ASSIMILATE CYGNSS DATA INTO NOAA'S OPERATIONAL HWRF, AND EVALUATE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THIS DATA SET INTO THE HURRICANE FORECASTING SYSTEM (HAFS) WHEN HAFS BECOMES AVAILABLE FOR TESTING. THE HAFS IS CURRENTLY BEING DEVELOPED AND IT IS EXPECTED TO REPLACE HWRF AS THE OPERATIONAL HURRICANE SYSTEM AT NOAA IN THE FUTURE.
2. EVALUATE THE QUALITY OF CYGNSS DATA USING THE LATEST RETRIEVAL ALGORITHMS PROVIDED BY THE CYGNSS SCIENCE TEAM. THE UPDATED DATASETS WILL BE ASSIMILATED INTO THE HURRICANE FORECAST MODEL AND CYGNSS IMPACT IN HURRICANE ANALYSIS AND FORECASTS WILL BE COMPARED AGAINST PREVIOUS IMPACTS, WHERE OLDER RETRIEVAL ALGORITHMS WERE USED.
3. INVESTIGATE DIFFERENT ASSIMILATION STRATEGIES. THESE STRATEGIES WILL INCLUDE MODIFICATIONS OF THE QUALITY CONTROLS AND ERROR CHARACTERISTICS STRUCTURES WITHIN THE ASSIMILATION ALGORITHMS TO OPTIMIZE THE IMPACT OF CYGNSS DATA IN HURRICANE PREDICTION.
4. EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF CYGNSS DATA USING A VARIETY OF METRICS AND ASSIMILATION STRATEGIES. PARALLEL DATA ASSIMILATION CYCLES WITH AND WITHOUT CYGNSS DATA WILL BE COMPARED IN TERMS OF THE TRACK, INTENSITY, RADIUS OF TROPICAL STORM FORCE WINDS, RADIUS OF MAXIMUM WINDS, HURRICANE STRUCTURE, PRECIPITATION AND INTEGRATED KINETIC ENERGY.
5. ASSESS THE BENEFITS OF USING MORE SOPHISTICATED FORWARD OPERATORS FOR THE ASSIMILATION OF CYGNSS PRODUCTS. THE NEW APPROACHES WILL AIM AT ASSIMILATING LESS PROCESSED PRODUCTS, WHERE OBSERVATION ERRORS ARE LESS CORRELATED.
DELIVERABLES:

USEFUL SOURCES OF OCEAN SURFACE WIND DATA AND SOIL MOISTURE RETRIEVALS. THIS PROPOSED PROJECT AIMS
TO ASSIMILATE CYGNSS DATA INTO NUMERICAL WEATHER PREDICTION MODELS FOR IMPROVED PREDICTION OF
HIGH-IMPACT WEATHER SYSTEMS, INCLUDING TROPICAL CYCLONES, TROPICAL CONVECTION, LANDFALLING
HURRICANES, AND HEAVY RAINFALLS THAT CAUSE FLOODS. AS A CURRENT MEMBER OF THE NASA CYGNSS
SCIENCE TEAM, THE PI AND STUDENTS PLAN TO CONDUCT THE FOLLOWING RESEARCH TASKS.
1) ASSIMILATION OF CYGNSS OCEAN SURFACE WINDS FOR IMPROVED PREDICTION AND UNDERSTANDING
OF TROPICAL CYCLONES AND TROPICAL CONVECTIONS
OWING TO ITS ABILITY TO OBTAIN WIND SPEEDS OVER THE CORE REGIONS OF TROPICAL CYCLONES AND
MESOSCALE CONVECTIVE SYSTEMS, CYGNSS PROVIDES UNIQUE DATA FOR IMPROVING TROPICAL CONVECTIVE
WEATHER PREDICTION. WITH NCEP OPERATIONAL HURRICANE WEATHER RESEARCH AND FORECASTING (HWRF)
MODEL USING THE OPERATIONAL GRIDPOINT STATISTICAL INTERPOLATION (GSI)-BASED HYBRID 3D-ENVAR DATA
ASSIMILATION SYSTEM, OUR PREVIOUS STUDIES (E.G., CUI ET AL. 2019 A AND B) HAVE PROVED THAT
ASSIMILATION OF CYGNSS OCEAN SURFACE WIND DATA HAS POSITIVE IMPACTS ON NUMERICAL PREDICTION OF
TROPICAL CYCLONES AND TROPICAL CONVECTIVE WEATHER SYSTEMS. DURING THE EXTENDED MISSION PERIOD,
WE WILL:
Ã¢Â‚¬Â¢ EXTEND SIMILAR DATA ASSIMILATION EFFORTS TO THE MOST RECENT HURRICANE SEASONS FOR THE QUASIOPERATIONAL
AND OPERATIONAL ASSIMILATION OF THE CYGNSS DATA IN THE NCEP OPERATIONAL
HWRF SYSTEM.
Ã¢Â‚¬Â¢ TRANSFER THE SAME CAPABILITY OF ASSIMILATING CYGNSS OCEAN SURFACE WINDS INTO THE
NCEP NEWLY DEVELOPED HURRICANE ANALYSIS AND FORECAST SYSTEM (HAFS) AND THE
NCEPÃ¢Â‚¬Â„¢S UNIFIED FORECAST SYSTEM (UFS) MODEL AT A CONFIGURATION OF THE GLOBAL
FORECASTING SYSTEM (GFS)-FINITE VOLUME CUBED-SPHERE DYNAMICAL CORE (FV3) FOR
IMPROVED PREDICTION OF TROPICAL CONVECTION OVER THE BROAD OPEN OCEAN.
Ã¢Â‚¬Â¢ CONTINUE EXAMINING THE IMPACT OF ASSIMILATION OF CYGNSS OCEAN SURFACE WINDS ON
NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS OF THE TROPICAL CONVECTIVE SYSTEMS DURING THE MADDEN-JULIAN
OSCILLATION (MJO) OVER THE MARITIME CONTINENT REGION, WITH THE GOALS TO BETTER
UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN TROPICAL CONVECTION
AND MJO.
2) ASSIMILATION OF CYGNSS SOIL MOISTURE DATA FOR IMPROVED HIGH-IMPACT WEATHER FORECASTING
IN A SERIES OF RECENT STUDIES, THE PI AND HER TEAM HAVE IMPLEMENTED AND PROVED THAT THE
STRONGLY COUPLED LAND-ATMOSPHERE DATA ASSIMILATION SYSTEM CAN IMPROVE LAND-ATMOSPHERE COUPLING
AND WEATHER ANALYSIS AND FORECASTS (SEE LIU AND PU 2019; LIN AND PU 2018, 2019, 2020). THEY
PU-CYGNSS -SOW OF 2 3
HAVE ALSO DEMONSTRATED THAT SURFACE ALBEDO AND SNOW DEPTH GREATLY INFLUENCE THE NEAR-SURFACE
ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS DURING THE WINTER WEATHER EVENTS, SUCH AS FOG OVER THE COMPLEX TERRAIN
(ZHANG AND PU 2019). MEANWHILE, THEIR STUDIES INDICATED THAT SOIL MOISTURE HAS SUBSTANTIAL
IMPLICATIONS FOR THE HURRICANE/TROPICAL CYCLONE INLAND EVOLUTION (ZHANG ET AL., 2019).
FOLLOWING THE PREVIOUS PROGRESS, THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THE PROPOSED WORK IS TO EXAMINE
THE IMPACT OF CYGNSS SOIL MOISTURE DATA PRODUCTS ON IMPROVING THE PREDICTION OF THE HIGH IMPACT
WEATHER SYSTEMS, INCLUDING 1) HEAVY RAINFALLS OVER U.S. GREAT PLAINS THAT CAUSE FLOODS AND 2) STRONG
WIND AND PRECIPITATION CAUSED BY INLAND EVOLUTION OF LANDFALLING HURRICANES, IN WHICH THE LANDATMOSPHERE
INTERACTIONS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR ACCURATE PREDICTION.
WE PROPOSE TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL BY ASSIMILATING CYGNSS SOIL MOISTURE DATA, ALONG WITH
MULTI-SATELLITE SOIL MOISTURE RETRIEVALS, SUCH AS THESE FROM SMAP, SMOS, AND OTHERS FROM THE
NOAA SOIL MOISTURE PRODUCTS SYSTEM (SMOPS) INTO THE COMMUNITY WEATHER RESEARCH AND
FORECASTING (WRF) MODEL COUPLED WITH NOAH (OR NOAH-MP) LAND SURFACE MODEL, IN
CONJUNCTION WITH NEAR-SURFACE ATMOSPHERIC OBSERVATIONS AND OTHER CONVENTIONAL AND SATELLITE DATA
USING A STRONGLY COUPLED LAND-ATMOSPHERE DATA ASSIMILATION. SPECIFICALLY, WE WILL:

NASA WOULD SPONSOR THE INSTRUMENTS TO FLY ON A LUNAR ORBITER DESIGNED BY THE KOREA AEROSPACE RESEARCH INSTITUTE (KARI). THE SPACECRAFT, THE KOREA PATHFINDER LUNAR ORBITER (KPLO), IS SCHEDULED TO LAUNCH IN DECEMBER 2018, AND IS PART OF KARI'S KOREA LUNAR EXPLORATION PROGRAM, WHICH AIMS TO ROBOTICALLY EXPLORE THE MOON THROUGH A SERIES OF ORBITER AND LANDER MISSIONS, STARTING WITH THE KPLO. KARI, HEADQUARTERED IN DAEJEON, SOUTH KOREA, PROVIDED NASA WITH ABOUT 33 POUNDS (15 KILOGRAMS) OF PAYLOAD MASS ABOARD THE KPLO, WHICH IS SCHEDULED TO LAUNCH INTO LUNAR ORBIT IN DECEMBER 2018. IN SEPTEMBER 2016, NASA ISSUED A SOLICITATION SEEKING SCIENCE INSTRUMENTS THAT COULD INCREASE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF VOLATILES, SUCH AS WATER, INCLUDING THE MOVEMENT OF SUCH RESOURCES TOWARD PERMANENTLY SHADOWED REGIONS AND HOW THEY BECOME TRAPPED THERE. SHADOWCAM WILL MAP THE REFLECTANCE WITHIN THE PERMANENTLY SHADOWED REGIONS TO SEARCH FOR EVIDENCE OF FROST OR ICE DEPOSITS. THE INSTRUMENT'S OPTICAL CAMERA IS BASED ON THE LUNAR RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER NARROW ANGLE CAMERA, BUT IS 800 TIMES MORE SENSITIVE, ALLOWING IT TO OBTAIN HIGH-RESOLUTION, HIGH SIGNAL-TO-NOISE IMAGING OF THE MOON'S PERMANENTLY SHADOWED REGIONS. SHADOWCAM WILL OBSERVE THE PSRS MONTHLY TO DETECT SEASONAL CHANGES AND MEASURE THE TERRAIN INSIDE THE CRATERS, INCLUDING THE DISTRIBUTION OF BOULDERS. NASA'S ADVANCED EXPLORATION SYSTEMS DIVISION (AES) LED THE PAYLOAD SOLICITATION AND SELECTION FOR THE NASA INSTRUMENT ON KPLO. A DIVISION OF THE HUMAN EXPLORATION AND OPERATIONS MISSION DIRECTORATE, AES USES INNOVATIVE APPROACHES AND PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS TO RAPIDLY DEVELOP PROTOTYPE SYSTEMS, ADVANCE KEY CAPABILITIES, AND VALIDATE OPERATIONAL CONCEPTS FOR FUTURE HUMAN MISSIONS BEYOND EARTH ORBIT.

INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND
CLINIMMUNE LABS (DR. FREED, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND CO-PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR ON THIS PROPOSAL) IS A 23,000-SF CLINICAL AND RESEARCH LABORATORY THAT INCLUDES THE HISTOCOMPATIBILITY LAB, THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO CORD BLOOD BANK, THE STEM CELL LAB (HEMATOPOIETIC AND MESENCHYMAL STEM CELLS AND CAR T CELLS) AND FLOW CYTOMETRY. THE LAB IS FDA-LICENSED AND ACCREDITED BY ASHI, FACT, AABB, CAP, AND CLIA. CLINIMMUNE HAS A STAFF OF 70 EMPLOYEES SKILLED IN ALL ASPECTS OF HLA TESTING AND STEM CELL TRANSPLANTS AND PERFORMS 20,000 HLA TESTS AND >200 STEM CELL TRANSPLANTS ANNUALLY. SINCE ITS INCEPTION, CLINIMMUNE HAS PERFORMED >2000 STEM CELL TRANSPLANTS IN HUMANS AND WAS ONLY THE SECOND CORD BLOOD BANK TO BE LICENSED BY THE FDA.

IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE AEROSPACE ENGINEERING SCIENCES DIVISION AT CU-BOULDER, WE ARE HYPOTHESIZING THAT GROWING HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELLS IN MICROGRAVITY MAY ALLOW A MUCH GREATER DEGREE OF EXPANSION TO OCCUR THAN ON EARTH, WHILE RETAINING THE DESIRED CELLULAR POPULATIONS THAT ENABLE SUCCESSFUL TRANSPLANTATION. THE AEROSPACE AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES DIVISION WILL DEVELOP SPECIALIZED BIOREACTOR TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL BE DEPLOYED ON A COMMERCIAL SPACE STATION AND SUPPORT THE EXPANSION OF CORD BLOOD OR MOBILIZED PERIPHERAL BLOOD HSCS COLLECTED ON EARTH, CRYOPRESERVED, AND TRANSPORTED FROZEN TO THE SPACE STATION PLATFORM. THE OVERALL GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEPLOY AN ARRAY OF STEM CELL EXPANSION BIOREACTORS ON ONE OR MORE SPACE STATIONS TO PRODUCE LARGE NUMBERS OF STEM CELL TRANSPLANT UNITS THAT CAN BE CRYOPRESERVED, RETURNED TO EARTH, AND USED CLINICALLY TO TREAT AN ASSORTMENT OF MEDICAL CONDITIONS IN PATIENTS WORLDWIDE. IF SUCCESSFUL, THE SAME IN-SPACE STEM CELL PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY MAY ALSO BE USED FOR FUTURE APPLICATIONS IN BIOREGENERATIVE MEDICINE.

SCOPE OF WORK
AS A PART OF THIS WORK, CLINIMMUNEÃ¢Â‚¬Â„¢S ROLE IS TO ISOLATE AND PURIFY CLINICAL GRADE CD34+ STEM CELLS FOR THE STUDY ALONG WITH GENE EDITED CELLS FOR THE SECOND FLIGHT STUDY. CLINIMMUNE WILL CHARACTERIZE THE CELLS BEFORE AND AFTER EXPANSION USING SEVERAL IN VITRO AND IN VIVO ASSAYS FOR HSC, INCLUDING THE COLONY FORMING ASSAY TO DETECT MULTIPLE LINEAGES AND A MOUSE ENGRAFTMENT ASSAY. INCLUDED IN THIS WILL BE THE NECESSARY FLOW CYTOMETRIC ASSAYS TO ANALYSE THE HSC BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER EXPANSION IN SPACE AND SUBSEQUENT CRYOPRESERVATION. WE WILL ALSO BE PROVIDING CONSULTATION ADVICE ON THE PROJECT THROUGHOUT ITS DURATION, INCLUDING TECHNICAL AND BUSINESS SUPPORT AS REQUIRED BY NASA REQUIREMENTS.

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE
THIS WORK WILL OCCUR BETWEEN JUNE 1ST, 2022 AND MAY 31ST, 2025.

PLACE OF PERFORMANCE
WORK WILL BE PERFORMED PRIMARILY AT CLINIMMUNE (BIOSCIENCE II). ALL MOUSE MODEL WORK FOR DETERMINING THE FUNCTIONAL STATUS POST EXPANSION WILL BE PERFORMED WITHIN THE RESEARCH BUILDINGS ON THE ANSCHUTZ CAMPUS AT UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO.

WORK REQUIREMENTS
THE FOLLOWING IS AN ITEMIZED LIST OF WORK REQUIREMENTS.
1. BEFORE THE FIRST FLIGHT EXPERIMENT, PROVISION OF CD34+ ISOLATED CELLS FOR CU-BOULDERÃ¢Â‚¬Â„¢S BIOREACTOR TESTING AND OPTIMIZATION.
2. CHARACTERIZATION OF CELL MATURITY AND LINEAGE DIFFERENTIATION BEFORE AND AFTER BIOREACTOR EXPANSION DURING PRE-FLIGHT EXPERIMENTS AND PRE AND POST THE FIRST FLIGHT.
3. FOR THE SECOND FLIGHT, PROVISION OF GENE EDITED CD34+ ISOLATED CELLS FOR EXPANSION ALONG WITH PRE AND POST-FLIGHT QUALITY ASSESSMENT OF CELLS EXPANDED IN SPACE VS THOSE EXPANDED ON THE GROUND.
4. FUNCTIONAL MOUSE ASSAYS TO ASSESS REPOPULATION OF THE HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL COMPARTMENTS.

SCHEDULE/MILESTONES/TASKS
CD34+ ISOLATION IS CURRENTLY ONGOING (EXPECTED TO CONTINUE INDEFINITELY). CELLS WILL BE PROVIDED STARTING IN JUNE OF 2022 TO THE AEROSPACE DIVISION TO BEGIN PRE-FLIGHT TRIALS. TESTING WILL OCCUR WHEN NECESSARY BASED ON BIOREACTOR EXPANSION AND SPACE FLIGHT TIMING.",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_80JSC022F0146_8000_80JSC019D0026_8000/,2024-11-25 00:00:00+00

ORBITAL ALSO SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOPED SPACECRAFT FOR SOLAR SYSTEM EXPLORATION TO INCLUDE THE CURRENTLY OPERATIONAL DAWN MISSION. THIS MISSION WAS LAUNCHED IN SEPTEMBER 2007, COMPLETED ITS RENDEZVOUS MISSION AT VESTA IN JULY 2012 AND IS EN ROUTE TO CERES IN EARLY 2015.  WITH SPACE AGENCY BUDGETS CONTINUING TO BE TIGHT, EXPLORATION PLANS NEED TO EMPHASIZE EVOLUTION OF EXISTING SYSTEMS, WHERE COST AND SCHEDULE IS BETTER CONTROLLED, AND DEVELOPMENT RISK REDUCED. SPECIFICALLY, ELEMENTS OF THE CURRENT ISS, INCLUDING CYGNUS, CAN BE EVOLVED TO SUPPORT MORE DISTANT SPACE DESTINATIONS. TO SUPPORT THESE ENDEAVORS, ORBITAL CONTRIBUTES TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCT IMPROVEMENT OF CYGNUS AND TO NEXTSTEP ACTIVITIES AND HAVE INVESTED IN THE COTS CRS PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP ENDEAVOR.  ORBITAL'S EXPLORATION AUGMENTATION MODULE (BAM) ARCHITECTURE USES A MODULAR, BUILDING BLOCK APPROACH THAT LEVERAGES THE CYGNUS SPACECRAFT TO EXPAND CISLUNAR AND LONG DURATION DEEP SPACE TRANSIT HABITATION CAPABILITIES AND TECHNOLOGIES CRITICAL TO NASAS LONG-TERM EXPLORATION GOALS.  ORBITALS ARCHITECTURE CONCEPT BLENDS IN-PRODUCTION HARDWARE WITH ADAPTATION, EVOLUTION, PLANNING, AND FORWARD THINKING. CYGNUS WILL SERVE AS A MODULAR HABITAT AND TEST PLATFORM FOR QUALIFYING TECHNOLOGIES IN A DISTANT RETROGRADE ORBIT (DRO) OR IN A LOW EARTH ORBIT (LEO), EITHER WHILE ATTACHED TO THE ISS OR AS A FREE-FLYER. USING THE EXISTING, OPERATIONAL CYGNUS TO PERFORM THESE MISSIONS HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF DECREASING OVERALL DEVELOPMENT TIME AND COSTS, AND FREEING UP RESOURCES THAT WOULD BE SPENT ON DEVELOPING A SPACECRAFT TO FOCUS ON CULTIVATING MISSION ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES.  THE GOAL IS TO HAVE A CYGNUS DERIVED EAM DEPLOYED IN CISLUNAR SPACE BEFORE 2020. THIS SPACECRAFT WILL BE THE FIRST BUILDING BLOCK IN SUPPORTING BOTH COMMERCIAL MARKETS AND GOVERNMENT OBJECTIVES. THE PROPOSED EFFORT FOR THIS NEXTSTEP BAA PHASE I, INVOLVES DEFINING AN EAM ARCHITECTURE AND CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS (CONOPS) THAT ADDRESSES COMMERCIAL MARKETS AND NASA EXPLORATION OBJECTIVES, TECHNOLOGY MATURATION PLANNING AND INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT, AND TO IDENTIFY TECHNOLOGIES THAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED AND DEMONSTRATED IN THE ISSILEO ENVIRONMENT WITHIN THE NEXT THREE YEARS.
