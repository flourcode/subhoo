IDENTIFICATION OF SPECIFIC LUNG PATHOGENS SUCH AS PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA (PSA) AS A CAUSE OF PNEUMONIA IS CRITICAL IN MITIGATING THE IMPACT OF ANTIMICROBIAL DRUG RESISTANCE. WHILE A LESS COMMON CAUSE OF COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA (CAP), THIS GRAM-NEGATIVE ROD (GNR) IS INTRINSICALLY RESISTANT TO SEVERAL ANTIBIOTIC CLASSES, INCLUDING B-LACTAMS, AND EXHIBITS FREQUENT MULTIDRUG RESISTANCE (MDR). THE PREVALENCE OF PSA IN CAP IS REPORTED AS VARIABLE, RANGING FROM 0 TO 23%, WITH A POOLED PREVALENCE OF 8.6% IN PEOPLE WITH IDENTIFIED RISKS FOR MDR INFECTIONS. IDENTIFICATION OF PSA IN CULTURES ENABLES SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTING AND TAILORING OF EMPIRIC THERAPY FOR BOTH CAP AND HOSPITAL- AND VENTILATOR-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA (HAP, VAP) IN HIGH-RISK PATIENTS. HOWEVER, THIS FREQUENTLY REQUIRES BAL SAMPLING AND CULTURE YIELD IS VARIABLE. IDENTIFICATION OF THE ORGANISM IS NOT AN ASSURANCE OF ACUTE DISEASE ETIOLOGY, AS COLONIZATION IS COMMON IN PEOPLE WITH POOR AIRWAY CLEARANCE, SUCH AS IN THOSE WITH BRONCHIECTASIS AND CYSTIC FIBROSIS (CF). VARIABLE PERFORMANCE, NON-SPECIFICITY OF CLINICAL FINDINGS, RELIANCE ON INVASIVE SAMPLING, AND TIME TO CULTURE DRIVE A HIGH AMOUNT OF ANTIBIOTIC EMPIRICISM, ULTIMATELY GENERATING AND PROPAGATING ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE (AMR).

THEREFORE, THERE REMAIN CRITICAL UNMET NEEDS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE PATIENT OUTCOMES WITH EASIER-TO-DEPLOY, LESS EXPENSIVE IVDS USING URINE AS AN ADJUNCT DIAGNOSTIC AID FOR PNEUMONIA.

IT IS DESIGNED FOR LOCAL APPLICATION ON CONTAMINATED AND INFECTED TISSUES TO STOP INFECTION EARLY, BEFORE IT BECOMES LIFE-THREATENING. THE SURFACTANT ACTIVITY ENHANCES TISSUE CLEANSING AND HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED BY MULTIPLE ASSAYS IN VITRO. THE MICROBICIDAL ACTIVITY IS BROAD SPECTRUM Ã¢Â‚¬Â€Œ EFFECTIVE AGAINST GRAM-POSITIVE AND GRAM-NEGATIVE BACTERIA, AS WELL AS YEAST. CLINICALLY IMPORTANT PATHOGENS SENSITIVE TO AMICIDIN-BETA INCLUDE MRSA, STAPHYLOCOCCUS EPIDERMIDIS, STREPTOCOCCUS PYOGENES, PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA, KLEBSIELLA SPP., AND E. COLI (INCLUDING ANTIBIOTIC- AND MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT STRAINS). AMICIDIN-BETA HAS ALSO BEEN SHOWN TO WORK WELL IN VITRO AND/OR IN VIVO WITH LOW-COST SYSTEMIC ANTIBIOTICS, INCLUDING CEFAZOLIN, CEFTRIAXONE, AND VANCOMYCIN. AMICIDIN-BETA/EF IS A PRODUCT FEATURING AMICIDIN-BETA THAT IS DESIGNED FOR DIRECT, LOCAL APPLICATION TO CONTAMINATED TISSUES TO PREVENT INFECTION, ESPECIALLY IN EMERGENCY SETTINGS. IT IS INTENDED FOR USE ON TRAUMATIC WOUNDS AND HIGH-RISK SURGICAL SITES, INCLUDING THOSE REQUIRING EXTENDED TISSUE COVERAGE. IN ADDITION, IT IS FORMULATED FOR VERSATILE APPLICATION Ã¢Â‚¬Â€Œ EITHER AS A LIQUID OR FOAM Ã¢Â‚¬Â€Œ FOR BETTER COATING OF DIFFERENT SURFACE GEOMETRIES RANGING FROM LARGE FLAT SURFACES (E.G., SCRAPES, BURNS) TO CAVITIES (E.G., SINUSES, UTERUS). BOTH TISSUE COVERAGE AND CAVITY FILLING PROPERTIES HAVE BEEN SHOWN IN VITRO. AMICIDIN-BETA/EF HAS DEMONSTRATED PRECLINICAL PROOF-OF-CONCEPT WITH MULTI-LOG REDUCTION IN MICROBIAL BURDEN IN A PORCINE MODEL WITH CONTAMINATED SURGICAL INCISIONS AND A RODENT WOUND MODEL WITH SURGICAL MESH IMPLANT. AMICIDIN-BETA/EF IS EXPECTED TO FIND SUBSTANTIAL USE IN EMERGENCY SETTINGS IN HIGH-INCOME COUNTRIES, AS WELL AS IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES. IT WOULD LIKELY BE USED FREQUENTLY IN CONTAMINATED TRAUMATIC INJURIES, INCLUDING PIERCING WOUNDS, OPEN TIBIAL FRACTURES, AND OTHERS. AS NOTED ABOVE, IT IS ALSO ANTICIPATED THAT AMICIDIN-BETA/EF WOULD FIND IMPORTANT USES IN CERTAIN HIGH-RISK SURGICAL PROCEDURES, INCLUDING EMERGENCY CAESAREAN DELIVERY, WHERE ITS FOAMING CAPACITY WOULD BE ESPECIALLY USEFUL IN FILLING A UTERINE CAVITY AFTER DELIVERY. THE PRESENT PROGRAM IS FOCUSED ON COMPLETING IND-ENABLING PRECLINICAL DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATORY FILINGS IN ANTICIPATION OF CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT. THIS INCLUDES (1) PERFORMANCE OF NONCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY AND GLP SAFETY; (2) DEVELOP AMICIDIN-BETA/EF PACKAGING, INCLUDING SHELF STABILITY STUDIES; AND (3) PREPARE FOR PHASE 1/2A CLINICAL TRIAL. AS PART OF THIS WORK, WE ALSO INTEND TO PERFORM COMPARATIVE STUDIES WITH AMICIDIN-BETA/EF PREPARATIONS OF INCREASING CONCENTRATION OF AMICIDIN-BETA. AN EFFECTIVE, LOCALLY APPLIED PRODUCT THAT STOPS INFECTION EARLY (EVEN BEFORE IT STARTS) WOULD BE VERY BENEFICIAL, ESPECIALLY IN EMERGENCY SETTINGS. INDIVIDUAL LIVES COULD BE SAVED, AND THE RISING TIDE OF ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE COULD BE SLOWED. THE ABILITY TO RAPIDLY COVER LARGE TISSUE SURFACES AND FILL CAVITIES IS ESSENTIAL. AMICIDIN-BETA/EF IS DESIGNED TO MEET THESE NEEDS.",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_75A50122C00028_7505_-NONE-_-NONE-/,2024-11-26 00:00:00+00

GERNER LAB (YEAR 6 BASE) 

THE GERNER LABORATORY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON (UW) SCHOOL OF MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF IMMUNOLOGY HAS A MAJOR ROLE IN THE IMPAC-TB MICROSCOPY, HIGH-DIMENSIONAL FLOW CYTOMETRY AND SINGLE CELL RNA SEQUENCING ANALYSIS STUDIES. THIS WORK WILL PROVIDE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW IMMUNE CELL HETEROGENEITY AND LOCALIZATION IN INFECTED LUNGS AND DRAINING LYMPH NODES INFLUENCES VACCINE EFFICACY AND MEDIATES PROTECTION AGAINST MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS (MTB), THUS ALLOWING FOR IMPROVED VACCINE DESIGN.

IN PARTICULAR, UW WILL STUDY THE CORRELATES OF IMMUNE PROTECTION DURING INFECTION WITH MTB SPECIFICALLY REGARDING THE ROLE OF CELLULAR RESPONSE HETEROGENEITY, IMMUNE CELL ORGANIZATION AND TISSUE MICROENVIRONMENTS IN LYMPHOID AND NON-LYMPHOID INFECTED TISSUES. UW WILL ALSO INVESTIGATE THE ROLES OF VARIOUS CHEMOTACTIC OR ADHESION MOLECULES IN GUIDING IMMUNE CELLS TO VARIOUS SITES WITHIN THE INFECTED LUNG TISSUES AND LYMPHOID ORGANS, AS WELL AS IN MEDIATING PROTECTION FROM MTB INFECTION. IN YEAR 6, THE GERNER LABORATORY AT UW WILL:

I. CONTINUE IMPLEMENTATION OF MICROSCOPY STUDIES AIMED TO UNDERSTAND THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF IMMUNE CELLS IN MTB INFECTED ANIMALS WITH AND WITHOUT VACCINATION, INCLUDING: TISSUE PROCESSING, MULTIPARAMETER CONFOCAL IMAGING, IMAGE ANALYSIS AND DATA STORAGE, AS WELL AS DATA INTEGRATION WITH OTHER RELATED STUDIES WITHIN THE IMPAC-TB PROJECT. SUBSTANTIAL EFFORT WILL BE PLACED ON FINALIZING STUDIES DESCRIBING THE ROLE OF NEUTROPHILS IN SHAPING LUNG GRANULOMA STRUCTURE AND IN IMMUNOREGULATION WITHIN THE GRANULOMA.

II. DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT EXPERIMENTS AIMED TO ELUCIDATE THE HETEROGENEITY OF INNATE AND ADAPTIVE IMMUNE RESPONSES WITHIN DRAINING LYMPH NODES DURING MTB INFECTION, WITH AND WITHOUT VACCINATION. SPECIFIC EFFORTS WILL BE PLACED ON ELUCIDATION OF CHANGES OCCURRING WITHIN THE MYELOID COMPARTMENT IN LYMPH NODES WHICH PROMOTE VERSUS INHIBIT FUNCTIONAL T CELL ACTIVATION AT DIFFERENT TIMEPOINTS DURING INFECTION. ADDITIONAL WORK WILL INVESTIGATE HOW BCG VACCINATION INHIBITS THE GENERATION OF MYELOID MICROENVIRONMENTS IN LNS WHICH SERVE AS A NICHE FOR CHRONIC MTB PERSISTENCE.

III. CONTINUE DEVELOPMENT OF HUMAN IMAGING PANELS TO STUDY IMMUNE CELL ORGANIZATION IN HUMAN INFECTED TISSUES (LUNG AND LYMPH NODE) OBTAINED FROM THE UGANDA POST-MORTEM STUDY, WITH DR STEVE COSE. PREVIOUS EFFORTS IDENTIFIED DIVERSE GRANULOMA STRUCTURES IN LUNGS FROM DECEASED INDIVIDUALS WITH ADVANCED DISEASE. UPCOMING WORK WILL ELUCIDATE ADDITIONAL IMMUNOLOGICAL FEATURES OF THESE STRUCTURES AND HOW THESE RELATE TO PROCESSES WITHIN THE DRAINING LNS. SPECIFIC GOAL WILL BE TO INVESTIGATE THE MICROANATOMY OF MTB INFECTION IN LUNG-DRAINING LNS, INCLUDING THE CELL TYPES, SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION, AND FUNCTIONAL STATES OF THE INFECTED CELLS. COMPARATIVE ANALYSES WITH MOUSE MODELS OF INFECTION (POINT II ABOVE) WILL BE PERFORMED.

IV. PERFORM ANALYSIS OF THE SPATIAL TRANSCRIPTOMICS DATA FOR LUNG GRANULOMAS OVER THE EARLY COURSE OF INFECTION WITH AND WITHOUT VACCINATION. IN THE PAST YEAR, WE HAVE COLLECTED LARGE NUMBERS OF SAMPLES OF EARLY LUNG LESIONS FOR THE SPATIAL TRANSCRIPTOMICS STUDY. IN THE COMING YEAR, THE GERNER LAB WILL PERFORM ANALYSIS OF THE DATASET, VALIDATE KEY FINDINGS, AND IDENTIFY KEY ACTIONABLE DIRECTIONS FOR FURTHER WORK. 

V.

YEAR 6 Ã¢Â‚¬Â€Œ BAROUCH

OUR RESEARCH PROJECTS IN THE PRECEDING YEARS OF THE AWARD FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING INNOVATIVE MURINE AEROSOL CHALLENGE MODELS FOR THE EVALUATION OF TUBERCULOSIS VACCINES. A RECENT PUBLICATION ESTABLISHED SUBSTANTIAL VACCINE PROTECTION WITH THE LIVE-ATTENUATED ÃŽÂ€?LPRG VACCINE STRAIN IN THE ULTRA LOW-DOSE MURINE AEROSOL CHALLENGE MODEL AS WELL AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NOVEL REPEATED ULTRA LOW- DOSE CHALLENGE MODEL THAT LED TO THE IDENTIFICATION OF CORRELATES OF VACCINE PROTECTION. WE OBSERVED THAT THE NOVEL REPEATED ULTRA LOW-DOSE CHALLENGE MODEL RESULTED IN INCREASED STRINGENCY AND REDUCED VACCINE EFFICACY IN TERMS OF PROTECTION FROM DETECTABLE INFECTION AND UNILATERAL INFECTION. IN YEAR 5 WE ESTABLISHED A SECOND-GENERATION MODEL IN WHICH WE FURTHER REDUCED THE CHALLENGE INOCULUM IN ORDER TO PRESERVE A MODEL OF REPEATED EXPOSURE WHILE REDUCING THE STRINGENCY OF CHALLENGE AND IMPROVING THE LIKELIHOOD OF RESOLVING VACCINE EFFICACY. 

RESEARCH EFFORTS IN YEAR 6 WILL FOCUS ON ASSESSING BCG AND ÃŽÂ€?LPRG VACCINE PROTECTION IN THIS SECOND-GENERATION MODEL IN THE CONTEXT OF A COMPREHENSIVE CORRELATES OF PROTECTION ANALYSIS.

EXPANSION OF MICROSCOPY CAPABILITIES IN IMPACTB CASCADE WORK WITH IBEX IMAGING OF HUMAN SAMPLES

AN EXTENSION OF WORK UNDER THE 75N93019C00070 CASCADE IMPAC-TB CONTRACT.

ONGOING IMPACTB CASCADE STUDIES USING 10-13-PLEX IMAGING HAVE PROVIDED MANY KEY INSIGHTS INTO CELL TYPE COMPOSITION AND LESION ORGANIZATION DURING MTB INFECTION ACROSS ANIMAL MODELS, AND MOST RECENTLY IN HUMAN LESIONS OF PATIENTS WITH END-STAGE DISEASE.

THE SUPPLEMENT WILL PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR THE FOLLOWING ACTIVITIES:

AIM 1: THE ULTRA-HIGH PLEX (IBEX) IMAGING APPROACH DEVELOPED BY DR. RONALD GERMAINÃ¢Â‚¬Â„¢S LAB AT THE NIH WILL BE USED TO BETTER CHARACTERIZE HUMAN LUNG LESIONS DURING MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS INFECTION. THIS WILL LEAD TO IMPROVED DEFINITION OF CELLULAR COMPOSITION AND HETEROGENEITY. ADOPTION OF THIS TECHNOLOGY WILL INITIALLY BE IMPLEMENTED ON AND APPLIED TO ALREADY AVAILABLE SAMPLES PROVIDED THROUGH THE ONGOING POST-MORTEM IMPACTB STUDIES IN UGANDA WITH STEVE COSE.

AIM 2: OBTAIN AND INCLUDE IN OUR WORKFLOW ADDITIONAL SAMPLES FROM A BROADER SPECTRUM OF LESION TYPES AND DISEASE STAGES. TO THIS END WE WILL ESTABLISH A COLLABORATION WITH DR. ADRIE STEYNÃ¢Â‚¬Â„¢S GROUP AT THE AFRICA HEALTH RESEARCH INSTITUTE (AHRI), LEVERAGING THEIR EXTENSIVE HUMAN LUNG TISSUE REPOSITORY AT THE ALBERT LUTHULI CENTRAL HOSPITAL AS PART OF THE HUMAN LUNG PROJECT. THROUGH THIS COLLABORATION, WE WILL OBTAIN HUMAN LUNG GRANULOMA SAMPLES AND LINKED DRAINING AND NON-DRAINING LNS FROM INDIVIDUALS WITH VARIOUS STAGES OF TB DISEASE. THESE SAMPLES WILL THEN BE ANALYZED USING THE IBEX IMAGING PIPELINE IN THE GERNER LAB.


USING IBEX ULTRA-HIGH PLEX IMAGING ON THESE UNIQUE AND PRECIOUS SAMPLES, WE WILL NOT ONLY BETTER DEFINE THE HETEROGENEITY OF HUMAN DISEASE AT A HIGH LEVEL OF CELLULAR AND SPATIAL RESOLUTION, BUT ALSO LINK HOW LUNG DISEASE AFFECTS PROCESSES TAKING PLACE IN ASSOCIATED LUNG DRAINING LYMPH NODES.",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_75N93019C00070_7529_-NONE-_-NONE-/,2024-12-26 00:00:00+00

A.	STRUCTURE DETERMINATION OF PROTEINS OR RNA MOLECULE BY NMR: 

UW-NMR WILL DETERMINE THE SOLUTION STRUCTURE OF PROTEINS OR RNA MOLECULES USING NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE (NMR)-BASED METHODS. THESE TARGETS WILL ORIGINATE FROM NIAID CATEGORY A-C INFECTIOUS DISEASE ORGANISMS, AS WELL AS EMERGING AND RE-EMERGING DISEASES AND ONCE APPROVED BY NIAID WILL ENTER INTO THE SSGCID PIPELINE FOR TRACKING THE UW-NMR WORK. THE NMR SPECTROSCOPY WILL BE MAINLY DEDICATED TO PROTEINS SMALLER THAN ~25 KDA THAT FAIL TO PRODUCE DIFFRACTION QUALITY CRYSTALS. THE CANDIDATE TARGETS WILL PRIMARILY BE IDENTIFIED FROM COMMUNITY REQUESTS AND INTERNAL BATCHES; SPECIFICALLY, THESE WILL BE TARGETS OF INTEREST TO THE CENTER THAT COULD NOT BE DETERMINED USING CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. HOWEVER, DR. VARANI WILL ALSO IDENTIFY RELEVANT COLLABORATORS HIMSELF WHO ARE WILLING TO NOMINATE TARGETS TO THE NMR PIPELINE AND ARE WILLING TO COLLABORATE TO PUBLISH ANY RESULTS PRODUCED BY SSGCID, ESPECIALLY IN THE AREA OF BACTERIAL AND VIRAL NON CODING RNAS. UW-NMR MAY ALSO BE ASKED TO LEAD AND SUPPORT HIGH VALUE TARGET (HVT), COMMUNITY REQUEST PROJECT (CRP), HIGHEST IMPACT PROJECT (HIP) AND OTHER SPECIAL STUDIES WITHIN THE SSGCID PIPELINE, AS DECIDED BY THE SSGCID SCIENTIFIC LEADERSHIP TEAM, WHENEVER OPPORTUNITIES ARISE FOR ADVANCING SCIENTIFIC PROBLEMS THAT MIGHT BEST BE ADDRESSED BY NMR.

CANDIDATES SUITABLE FOR FURTHER EXAMINATION WILL BE IDENTIFIED FROM 1H-15N HSQC SPECTRA COLLECTED ON 15N-LABELED PROTEIN PREPARED BY UW-NMR. STANDARD TRIPLE RESONANCE EXPERIMENTS WILL BE PERFORMED TO ASSIGN THE BACKBONE AND THE SIDE CHAIN RESONANCES OF THE PROTEIN. ONCE THE RESONANCE ASSIGNMENTS ARE COMPLETE, NOE DATA CRUCIAL FOR OBTAINING DISTANCE RESTRAINTS WILL BE COLLECTED. NOE ASSIGNMENTS AND STRUCTURE CALCULATIONS WILL BE PERFORMED ITERATIVELY USING COMBINED AUTOMATED AND MANUAL METHODS. THE QUALITY OF THE FINAL SET OF STRUCTURES WILL BE ASSESSED AND ONCE THE FINAL ENSEMBLE OF STRUCTURES IS FOUND TO BE SATISFACTORY, THE COORDINATES OF THE ENSEMBLE AND THE MEAN STRUCTURE WILL BE DEPOSITED IN THE PROTEIN DATA BANK (PDB; HTTP://WWW.PDB.ORG) AND IMMEDIATELY RELEASED TO THE WORLD. AT THE SAME TIME, ALL 1H, 13C AND 15N CHEMICAL SHIFT DATA WILL BE DEPOSITED WITH THE BIOMAGNETIC RESEARCH BANK (BMRB; HTTP://WWW.BMRB.WISC.EDU/). MANUSCRIPTS THAT INCLUDE A DESCRIPTION OF THESE STRUCTURES WILL BE PUBLISHED IN AS TIMELY A FASHION AS IS POSSIBLE.

THE UN-NMR GROUP WILL LEAD A PROJECT ON STRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATION OF AN ESSENTIAL RNA PACKAGING ELEMENT FROM THE INFLUENZA A VIRUS.

C.	QUALITY CONTROL, DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING:

UW-NMR WILL ESTABLISH AND CONDUCT QUALITY CONTROL PROCEDURES AS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THE PRODUCTION OF HIGH QUALITY DATA ON WELL-DEFINED PROTEIN AND RNA SAMPLES. UW-NMR WILL ENSURE THAT THE STATUS OF ALL WORK PERFORMED FOR SSGCID IS UPDATED IN A TIMELY FASHION, THROUGH THE CENTRAL TARGET TRACKING DATABASE (CTTDB), TRACKING SPREADSHEETS AND/OR ANY OTHER TRACKING SYSTEM REQUIRED BY THE PROJECT. DR. VARANI WILL PARTICIPATE IN SSGCID PROJECT MEETINGS AND NIAID-REQUIRED MEETINGS TO ENSURE THE SUCCESS OF THE PROJECT. DR. VARANI WILL CONTRIBUTE TO QUARTERLY AND SEMI-ANNUAL PROGRESS REPORTS AND ANY OTHER NIAID REQUIRED REPORTS AS NEEDED AND IN A TIMELY FASHION AND WILL CONDUCT THE PROJECT WORK WITH THE AIM OF PRODUCING IMPACTFUL PUBLICATIONS.

ACCORDINGLY, TO BIOINFORMATICALLY CHARACTERIZE THE SEQUENCE CONSERVATION OF IDENTIFIED EPITOPES ACROSS DIFFERENT VIRAL VARIANTS AND DIFFERENT VIRAL SPECIES DERIVED FROM EACH OF THE VIRAL FAMILIES OF CONCERN, WE WILL: 
1.	USE THE CD-HIT ALGORITHM TO CONTROL FOR THE IMPACT OF SAMPLING BIAS ON ESTIMATES, ENABLING US TO BOTH PROVIDE EFFECTIVE COVERAGE AND OPTIMAL T CELL INDUCTION, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME ALLOWING US TO ANTICIPATE THE NEXT OUTBREAK THAT COULD EMERGE FROM OTHER SOURCE SPECIES. 
2.	DOWNLOAD SEQUENCES FOR EACH OF THE PROTEINS FROM DIFFERENT VIRAL ISOLATES FROM THE BV-BRC DATABASE. SEQUENCES WILL BE PROCESSED USING CD-HIT AT DIFFERENT SIMILARITY THRESHOLDS. 
3.	EVALUATE THE RESULTING SEQUENCE SETS BY PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS TO SELECT THE OPTIMAL SEQUENCE SIMILARITY THRESHOLD THAT PROVIDES FOR EQUAL REPRESENTATION OF SEQUENCES WITH LONG AND SHORT BRANCH LENGTHS. 
4.	PRODUCE A COLLECTION OF SEQUENCES FOR EACH OF THE PROTEINS AND TAXONOMIC GROUPS THAT EQUALLY REPRESENTS THE SEQUENCE DIVERSITY OF THE GROUP. 
5.	UTILIZE MUSCLE TO ALIGN PROTEIN SEQUENCES FROM EACH COLLECTION. 
6.	CALCULATE THE EXTENT OF SEQUENCE CONSERVATION/VARIATION AT EACH ALIGNED POSITION USING THREE METRICS: PERCENT IDENTITY TO THE CONSENSUS RESIDUE, AVERAGE BLOSUM SCORE IN COMPARISON WITH THE CONSENSUS RESIDUE, AND ENTROPY SCORE. 
7.	IDENTIFY PROTEIN REGIONS OF CONSERVATION USING THE MEDIAN VALUE OF EACH OF THESE METRICS IN A SLIDING WINDOW OF 10 RESIDUES. 
8.	EVALUATE THE DISTRIBUTIONS OF EACH METRIC TO ESTABLISH CUTOFFS FOR DEFINING REGIONS WITH HIGH AND MODERATE SEQUENCE CONSERVATION FOR EACH OF THE PROTEIN AND TAXONOMIC GROUPS, AND THE RESULTS COMBINED TO DERIVE A CONSENSUS CONSERVATION SCORE. IF THE APPROACH FOR SELECTING CONSERVATION SCORE CUTOFFS PRODUCES TOO MANY OR TOO FEW CANDIDATE REGIONS, WE WILL MANUALLY ADJUST THE CONSERVATION SCORE CUTOFFS TO PRODUCE A REASONABLE NUMBER OF CANDIDATE EPITOPES/REGIONS. 
9.	DERIVE CONSENSUS REGION/SEQUENCE FOR EACH GROUP, AND THEN PARSE EACH INTO 9-MER, 10-MER, AND 15-MER PEPTIDES. 
10.	PREPARE REPORTS REGARDING THE SEQUENCE CONSERVATION ANALYSIS FOR SUBMISSION TO NIH.

MICROORGANISMS THAT CAUSE FRI INCLUDE S. AUREUS, COAGULATE-NEGATIVE STAPHYLOCOCCUS SPP., ENTEROCOCCUS SPP., AND AEROBIC GRAM-NEGATIVE BACILLI. THE POTENTIAL INFECTING PATHOGEN IS UNKNOWN AT THE TIME OF TRAUMATIC INSULT AND INITIAL SURGERY. CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES RECOMMEND 2-5 DAYS OF SYSTEMIC ANTIBIOTICS FOLLOWING TRAUMATIC INJURY TO PREVENT FRI. DESPITE THIS, TRAUMATIC FRACTURES HAVE A HIGH INFECTION RATE (UP TO 40%). FRI OFTEN REQUIRES MULTIPLE SURGICAL PROCEDURES, LEADING TO SUBSTANTIAL MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY WITH AN UP TO 25% 5-YEAR MORTALITY RISK. CURRENT STRATEGIES DO NOT ADEQUATELY PREVENT THE INFECTIONS THAT LEAD TO FRI'S HIGH MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY BURDEN, AND FRI REMAINS AN UNMET MEDICAL NEED AND REQUIRES A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO THAT CURRENTLY EMPLOYED. PLG0206, ADMINISTERED AT THE TIME OF INJURY, THROUGH ITS RAPIDLY ACTING BROAD-SPECTRUM ACTIVITY AGAINST THE PATHOGENS COMMONLY CAUSING FRI HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ADDRESS THIS UNMET NEED. PLG0206 WILL BE ADMINISTERED FOLLOWING TRAUMATIC INJURY IN THE OPERATING THEATER AFTER SURGICAL DEBRIDEMENT AND BONE FIXATION AS A LONG-ACTING CONTROLLED RELEASE FORMULATION. IT IS EXPECTED TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THE CURRENT STANDARD OF CARE BY PROVIDING LONG-LASTING PATHOGEN-INACTIVATING DRUG LEVELS TO PREVENT INFECTION NIDI (DEVITALIZED AND CONTAMINATED BONE AND SOFT TISSUE AND METAL FIXATION DEVICES) THAT LEAD TO INVASIVE INFECTION. THE EXPECTED LIMITED SYSTEMIC EXPOSURE WITH LOCAL DRUG DEPOT SHOULD ENSURE A GOOD SAFETY PROFILE. THE DEVELOPMENT PLAN WILL ASSESS THE IN VITRO AND IN VIVO RELEASE CHARACTERISTICS OF VARIOUS PLG0206 CONTROLLED-RELEASE FORMULATIONS ALONG WITH PK, TOLERABILITY, AND EFFICACY IN ANIMAL MODELS OF FRI. ADDITIONAL STUDIES WILL IDENTIFY THE MOST EFFECTIVE, WELL-TOLERATED CONCENTRATION TO BE USED IN HUMAN TRIALS TO ESTABLISH SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF LOCAL ADMINISTRATION IN THE PREVENTION OF FRI IN CONJUNCTION WITH CURRENT STANDARD OF CARE.",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_75A50122C00028_7505_-NONE-_-NONE-/,2024-12-20 00:00:00+00

STUDY COORDINATOR IN CASE IDENTIFICATION AND DATA EXTRACTION. DR. SUSAN ELIAS WILL OVERSEE DATA MANAGEMENT AT
THE MHIR SITE AND COÃ¢Â‚¬Ï¿½ORDINATE WITH THE TEAMS AT MGH AND TUFTSMEDICINE TO ASSURE STANDARDIZATION. THE FIRST
YEAR OF WORK WILL INVOLVE COORDINATED (MGH, TUFTS, MAINEHEALTH) MODEL DEVELOPMENT, VALIDATION, AND
DEPLOYMENT AS DESCRIBED IN THE FULL PROPOSAL. WE WILL FIRST CREATE A BASELINE MODEL OF SUBJECTS WHO ARE
DIAGNOSED AS HAVING LYME DISEASE BY ICD9/10 CODES. WE WILL THEN WORK TO DERIVE IMPROVED MODELS BY
IDENTIFYING INFORMATIVE DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FROM CLINICAL, EPIDEMIOLOGICAL, MICROBIOLOGICAL AND FREE TEXT DATA IN
CASE AND CONTROL VISITS.
WE WILL COMPARE THE PERFORMANCE OF ONE OR MORE IMPROVED MODELS AND SELECT THE BEST PERFORMING ONE. WE
WILL IMPLEMENT THE SELECTED MODEL FOR RECORD REVIEW AT MAINEHEALTH, SUMMARIZE THE RESULTS, AND AGGREGATE
SUMMARY STATISTICS ACROSS SITES. BASED UPON A UNIFIED, EFFECTIVE CASE DEFINITION AND A ROBUST MODEL TO IDENTIFY
CASES OF LYME DISEASE FROM EPIC DATA, WE WILL CONDUCT TARGETED INVESTIGATIONS TO ANSWER SPECIFIC QUESTIONS. WE
WILL IDENTIFY POTENTIAL RECRUITMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR RESEARCH SUBJECTS BASED UPON SPECIFIC CRITERIA (E.G.
NEUROBORRELIOSIS, PREGNANCY, IMPACT OF COÃ¢Â‚¬Ï¿½INFECTIONS, VACCINATION) DEFINED IN CONSULTATION WITH THE FULL

THE GOAL OF IMPAC-TB IS TO IDENTIFY MECHANISMS OF PROTECTIVE IMMUNITY AGAINST TB, AND OUR OVERALL STRATEGY FOR THE CASCADE IMPAC-TB ANIMAL PROGRAM IS TO START WITH GOLD-STANDARDS OF VACCINE-MEDIATED PROTECTION (I.E, CMV/TB AND IV BCG IN NHP; BCG IN MICE) AND THEN DISSECT HOW PROTECTION IS MEDIATED. THE AKAGERA MRNA VACCINE REPRESENTS A NEW GOLD STANDARD FOR PREVENTION OF INFECTION Ã¢Â‚¬Â€Œ THE BEST VACCINE-MEDIATED PROTECTION EVER OBSERVED IN MICE. TO ACHIEVE OUR GOAL OF IDENTIFYING MECHANISMS OF TB IMMUNITY, CASCADE IMPAC-TB WOULD LIKE TO IDENTIFY THE ANTIGENS AND T CELL SUBSETS THAT MEDIATE THE PROTECTION PROVIDED BY THE NEW AKAGERA MRNA VACCINE, WHICH SHOWS THE BEST VACCINE-MEDIATED PROTECTION EVER OBSERVED IN MICE. 

THE SPECIFIC WORK TO BE PERFORMED IS DETAILED BELOW. UNDER ALL THREE AIMS, AKAGERA MEDICINES WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR CREATING THE MRNA VACCINE CONSTRUCTS REQUIRED FOR EACH EXPERIMENT. IN ADDITION, SCIENTISTS AT AKAGERA MEDICINES WILL ALSO MEET REGULARLY WITH SCIENTISTS AT SCRI TO EVALUATE PROGRESS, DESIGN NEW CONSTRUCTS, AND TROUBLE-SHOOT, AS NECESSARY. 

AIM 1: IDENTIFY PROTECTIVE ANTIGENS IN THE AKAGERA MRNA VACCINE. 
AKAGERA MEDICINES WILL PREPARE SEPARATE MRNA VACCINE CONSTRUCTS FOR 4 ORFS (TB10.4, MTB39, AND ESAT-6 WHICH ARE THE MOST IMMUNOGENIC ANTIGENS IN THE MRNA VACCINE, AND MTB32, WHICH ALONG WITH MTB39 IS PART OF THE M72 VACCINE). THESE WILL BE SENT TO SCRI FOR TESTING IN MICE, TO COMPARE THE PROTECTIVE EFFICACY OF THE PARENTAL MRNA VACCINE, EACH OF THESE 4 CONSTRUCTS INDIVIDUALLY, POOLED ADMINISTRATION OF TB10.4, MTB39, ESAT-6 MRNA CONSTRUCTS, AND THAT SAME POOL WITH THE ADDITION OF MTB32. SCRI WILL MEASURE THE THREE METRICS OF IMMUNITY THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY DEFINED IN THE ULD MODEL: REDUCTION OF LUNG BACTERIAL BURDENS, PREVENTION OF DISSEMINATION TO THE CONTRALATERAL LUNG, AND PREVENTION OF DETECTABLE INFECTION. COLONIES WILL BE COLLECTED, DNA ISOLATED, AND BAR-CODES AMPLIFIED AND SEQUENCED TO DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF FOUNDING MTB STRAINS IN EACH LUNG. BECAUSE THE GROUP SIZES WILL HAVE TO BE REDUCED TO 15 MICE (RATHER THAN OUR MORE STANDARD 20) TO ACCOMMODATE THE NUMBER OF VACCINES TESTED SIMULTANEOUSLY, THE EXPERIMENT WILL BE REPEATED FOUR TIMES TO ASSURE REPRODUCIBILITY AND STATISTICAL RIGOR. IF PROTECTION CONFERRED BY THE THREE OR FOUR POOLED ANTIGENS IS NOT SIMILAR TO THAT CONFERRED BY THE PARENT VACCINE, AKAGERA MEDICINES WILL SYNTHESIZE ADDITIONAL ANTIGENS UNTIL A COCKTAIL OF ANTIGENS THAT CONFERS SIMILAR PROTECTION IS FOUND.
AIM 2: IDENTIFY AND ELIMINATE CD8 EPITOPES FROM MRNA VACCINE CONSTRUCTS. 
THIS AIM WILL FOCUS ON EACH ANTIGEN THAT CONFERRED SOME DEGREE OF PROTECTION AGAINST ESTABLISHING SUSTAINED INFECTION IN AIM 1. ANTIGENS THAT DID NOT PREVENT DETECTABLE INFECTION WILL NOT BE EXAMINED FURTHER IN AIM 2. IN PRIOR CD8 EPITOPE MAPPING STUDIES, TB10.4 IS KNOWN TO HAVE TWO EPITOPES, TB10.4 ON THE H-2B BACKGROUND (C57BL/6) AND TB10.4 ON THE H-2D BACKGROUND (BALB/C), AND MTB32A IS KNOWN TO HAVE ONE EPITOPE ON THE H-2B BACKGROUND (C57BL/6) (MTB32). THUS, IF THESE ANTIGENS ARE FOUND TO CONTRIBUTE TO PREVENTION OF INFECTION IN AIM 1, AKAGERA MEDICINES WILL MAKE A TRUNCATED TB10.4 OR MTB32A CONSTRUCT THAT LACKS THE RESPECTIVE CD8 EPITOPES, BUT WHICH WOULD STILL CONTAIN KNOWN CD4 EPITOPES. FOR MTB39 AND ESAT6, THE CD8 EPITOPES HAVE NOT BEEN MAPPED, BUT IF EITHER MTB39 OR ESAT-6 WERE SHOWN IN AIM 1 TO CONTRIBUTE TO PREVENTING INFECTION, AKAGERA WOULD GENERATE OVERLAPPING PEPTIDES FOR EACH ANTIGEN AND MAP THE EPITOPE(S) RESPONSIBLE USING STIMULATIONS ASSAYS WITH SPLENOCYTES FROM IMMUNIZED B6XBALB/C F1 MICE. AFTER IDENTIFYING THE EPITOPES, AKAGERA MEDICINES WOULD GENERATE NEW CONSTRUCTS THAT SPECIFICALLY LACKED THE CD8 EPITOPES, EITHER VIA TRUNCATION OR POINT MUTATION OF AMINO ACID RESIDUES PREDICTED TO BE CRITICAL FOR THE RESPONSE.

THROUGH THE EXECUTION OF THIS CONTRACT, WE WILL EXAMINE BASIC INDUCTION OF INNATE AND ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY FROM VACCINATION, INCLUDING STUDIES THAT ADDRESS NONTUBERCULOUS MYCOBACTERIA (NTM) INTERFERENCE, RNA VACCINE DELIVERY, PRIME-BOOST REGIMENS (INCLUDING BCG PRE-EXPOSURE), TRANSCRIPTOMIC HOST SIGNATURES, SYSTEMS BIOLOGY AND DURABLE IMMUNE MEMORY FOR THE FURTHER ADVANCEMENT OF THE EFFORT TO DESIGN AND EVALUATE AN EFFICACIOUS VACCINE AGAINST MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS (M.TB)

THE WORK UNDER THIS CONTRACT MAY INCLUDE THE POSSIBLE DISTRIBUTION OF DE-IDENTIFIED HUMAN SUBJECT PERIPHERAL BLOOD MONONUCLEAR CELLS (PBMC), SERUM, AND OTHER CLINICAL SAMPLES TO SCRI AND THE PHOENIX PARTNERS. NHP SAMPLES AND/OR DOWNSTREAM DATA MAY BE SHARED WITH THE PARTNERS ON THIS CONTRACT. 

OPTION 3 ACTIVITIES: EVALUATE OPTIMIZED M.TB VACCINE CANDIDATES FOR SAFETY, IMMUNOGENICITY AND EFFICACY IN THE NHP MODEL OF TB

TASK 3.5 TRANSCRIPTOMIC ANALYSIS OF NHP SAMPLES. 
FHCC WILL EXECUTE GENE EXPRESSION PROFILING WITH RNASEQ/NANOSTRING ASSAYS ON NHP SAMPLES GENERATED IN OPTION 3 AT UKHSA. TRANSCRIPTOMIC ANALYSIS WILL BE FOCUSED ON IDENTIFYING A PERIPHERAL BLOOD SURROGATE ENDPOINT FOR THE M.TB ERDMAN ULDA CHALLENGE OUTCOMES. THE INITIAL UNBIASED RNA SEQUENCING APPROACH WILL USE WHOLE-BLOOD SAMPLES FROM PRE- AND POST-CHALLENGE TIME POINTS. SPECIFICALLY, WE WILL LOOK FOR TRANSCRIPTS THAT ARE CORRELATED WITH M.TB COLONY FORMING UNITS (CFU) AND M.TB QPCR ASSAYS FROM BRONCHOALVEOLAR LAVAGE (BAL), THE PRIMARY CHALLENGE OUTCOMES. IN ADDITION TO ABSOLUTE ABUNDANCE AT POST-CHALLENGE TIME POINTS, WE WILL ALSO LOOK FOR CHANGES IN TRANSCRIPT ABUNDANCE RELATIVE TO THE DAY OF CHALLENGE AS A POTENTIAL CORRELATE OF CHALLENGE OUTCOME. AS WE BUILD A MODEL TO PREDICT CHALLENGE OUTCOME FROM THESE GENE EXPRESSION MEASURES WE WILL SPECIFICALLY CONSIDER TRANSCRIPTS THAT HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN IDENTIFIED AS PREDICTORS OF PROGRESSION TO TB DISEASE, SUCH AS TYPE I IFN-RELATED GENES WHOSE EXPRESSION INCREASES DURING DISEASE PROGRESSION. THE HUMAN EXPRESSION SIGNATURES WILL BE EVALUATED IN NHPS AND VICE VERSA; ADDITIONALLY, A JOINT MODEL WILL BE DEVELOPED, ALLOWING FOR DIFFERENCES IN NHP AND HUMAN ASSOCIATIONS, WHILE IDENTIFYING A COMMON GENE SIGNATURE. ONCE TRANSCRIPTS OR GENES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED, A TARGETED CROSS-SPECIES NANOSTRING PANEL WILL BE DEVELOPED FOR EVALUATION IN THE SMALL ANIMAL MODELS AS WELL AS IN FUTURE NHP AND CLINICAL TRIALS. WE PLAN TO DEVELOP A NANOSTRING NCOUNTER GENE PANEL WHICH CAN ACCOMMODATE UP TO 800 GENES AND WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE COST EFFECTIVE THAN RNA SEQUENCING. ALTERNATIVELY, DEPENDING ON THE COMPLEXITY OF THE GENE PANEL, IT COULD BE DEVELOPED AS A 96 TRANSCRIPT/GENE (INCLUDING HOUSEKEEPING GENES) QPCR BIOMARK FLUIDIGM ASSAY. 
TASK 3.7 COMPARE IMMUNE PROFILES IN NHP, SMALL ANIMAL MODELS AND HUMANS TO IDENTIFY CORRELATES OF PROTECTION. 
SUBTASK 3.7.4 INTEGRATED ANALYSIS AND DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS MODELING OF EXPERIMENTAL IMMUNOLOGY DATA ACROSS ALL SPECIES
